This package is a core component of the [mcp_flutter](https://github.com/Arenukvern/mcp_flutter) project. It acts as the "client-side" library within your Flutter application, enabling the Model Context Protocol (MCP) `MCP Server` to perform Flutter-specific operations like retrieving application errors, capturing screenshots, and getting view details.

> Please notice:

> - The architecture of package may change significantly.

## Data Transparency

This package is designed to be transparent and easy to understand. It is built on top of the Dart VM Service Protocol, which is a public protocol for interacting with the Dart VM.

To make it simple and customizable - it divided into groups of methods which acts as method handlers.

For example, to add Flutter tools, you can use `initializeFlutterToolkit()` method like one below.

All methods are available only in debug mode and wrapped in assert statements.

```dart
MCPToolkitBinding.instance
  // Initializes the Toolkit
  ..initialize()
  // Adds Flutter related methods to the MCP server
  ..initializeFlutterToolkit();
```

## Features

- Auto register tools and resources in MCP server:

```dart
addMcpTool(
  MCPCallEntry.tool(
    definition: MCPToolDefinition(
      name: 'calculate_fibonacci',
      description: 'Calculate the nth Fibonacci number and return the sequence',
      inputSchema: ObjectSchema(
        required: ['n'],
        properties: {
          'n': IntegerSchema(
            description: 'The position in the Fibonacci sequence (0-100)',
            minimum: 0,
            maximum: 100,
          ),
        },
      ),
    ),
    handler: (final request) {
      final n = int.tryParse(request['n'] ?? '0') ?? 0;
      return MCPCallResult(
        message: 'Fibonacci number at position $n is ${fibonacci(n)}',
        parameters: {'result': fibonacci(n)},
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

- **VM Service Extensions**: Registers a set of custom VM service extensions (e.g., `ext.mcp.toolkit.app_errors`, `ext.mcp.toolkit.view_screenshots`, `ext.mcp.toolkit.view_details`).
- **Error Reporting**: Captures and makes available runtime errors from the Flutter application.
- **Screenshot Capability**: Allows external tools to request screenshots of the application's views.
- **Application Details**: Provides a mechanism to fetch basic details about the application's views.

## Integration

1.  **Add as a Dependency**:
    Add `mcp_toolkit` to your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file.

    If you have the `mcp_flutter` repository cloned locally, you can use a path dependency:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      # ... other dependencies
      mcp_toolkit: ^0.4.0 # Use the latest version
    ```

    Then, run `flutter pub get` in your Flutter project's directory.

2.  **Initialize in Your App**:
    In your Flutter application's `main.dart` file (or equivalent entry point), initialize the bridge binding:

    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    import 'package:mcp_toolkit/mcp_toolkit.dart'; // Import the package
    import 'dart:async';

    Future<void> main() async {
      runZonedGuarded(
        () async {
          WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
          MCPToolkitBinding.instance
            ..initialize() // Initializes the Toolkit
            ..initializeFlutterToolkit(); // Adds Flutter related methods to the MCP server
          runApp(const MyApp());
        },
        (error, stack) {
          // Optionally, you can also use the bridge's error handling for zone errors
          MCPToolkitBinding.instance.handleZoneError(error, stack);
        },
      );
    }

    // ... rest of your app code
    ```
